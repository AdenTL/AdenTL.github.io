        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I have completed a full stack developement bootcamp specializing in ASP.NET applications. Before the bootcamp, I spent my free time preparing and introduced myself to the C# fundamentals to help future me stay on top of assignments. I am a very 'people-driven' person and will go the extra step for the ones I work with to ensure workplace stability, comaraderie and communication. I like to work on projects with people and have the chance to exchange knowledge with others and establish positive relationships!
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time I do many things like play drums, ride mountain bikes, exercise, spend time with friends and family, find new music and learn how to play my favorites, and I also have a love for nature science!
