        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! Welcome to my portfolio! Allow me introduce myself. I am a software developer who is attending a bootcamp to further my capabilities with C# programming and the many tools used in conjunction to create software or web applications. I enjoy working with computers in general, as I have always had an interest in working with them as a career. I remember choosing my first career goal, or "What do I want to be when I grow up?" in middle school and I chose a "Software engineer Technician". I attended college for computer science, and took an operating systems class, but I was not convinced the path I was on was the right one for me. So I put my 'becoming a computer wizard' ambitions to the side and focused on my job at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I began learning the C# programming language, it was now clear to me what I wanted to pursue as a career. I was already on a good first step, thanks to having a really great support system on my side to help me navigate to the right path for me.
